# Build a Voting App

A Free Code Camp Dynamic Web Application Project. A Full Stack Javascript App using Node, Express, Passport, MongoDB, React/Redux and Semantic UI with Google Material theme.

This is the React client side of the Fullstack App. The server side can be found at https://github.com/minhkashyu/nightlife-coordination-backend.

You can run the App at https://mks-nightlife-coordination-app.herokuapp.com/.

NOTE: This app on heroku has a web dyno, and if the web dyno receives no traffic in a 30 minute period, the web dyno will sleep. If you access the app when the web dyno is sleeping, you will experience a short delay. After that, the web dyno will become active and the app will run fast. Also the api of the app has another web dyno, and as a result, the first data loading will have a delay as well.
